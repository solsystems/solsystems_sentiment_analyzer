AKT--Success p_content: News  Energy and Natural Resources Reporter More than a dozen Texas-based energy companies have penned a letter pushing back on President Trump’s signature "Big Beautiful Bill,“ arguing the legislation could stunt economic development, hike consumer energy costs and kill jobs in the state.  The sweeping tax and spending bill was passed by the U.S. House on May 22 and is pending in the Senate. The bill’s provisions include accelerating the repeal of renewable energy tax credits, such as the Clean Electricity Investment Credit and Residential Clean Energy Credit. The Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance ― comprised of companies that operate in the clean energy space, including Schneider Electric, XGS Energy, EnPhase and EDF ― wrote to GOP Senator John Cornyn in an effort to preserve key tax credits. They argue those initiatives have aided in the success of the state’s energy industry. “Texas is projected to see over $458 billion new private sector investment and $54 billion in new advanced energy manufacturing — private investment catalyzed by sensible, technology-agnostic federal tax credits," the letter reads.

According to the alliance, projects being developed across the state would be impacted, including a battery and microinverter manufacturer facility in Arlington, an electric vehicle charging manufacturer also in Arlington and a rare Earth manufacturer near Fort Worth. The group — representing a cross-section of companies headquartered, building projects and facilities, creating jobs and investing billions of dollars in the state — said they intend to keep Texas an energy leader as the state and nation is poised to experience a surge in electricity demand for the first time in more than two decades. With the growth of artificial intelligence, building electrification and advanced manufacturing addressing the energy need will require a diverse, reliable energy portfolio including wind, solar and storage, nuclear, geothermal and more. The industry leaders said they have the “opportunity to accelerate the advanced manufacturing renaissance” that creates jobs, bolsters the economy and allows America to compete with the rest of the world. “Advanced energy technologies and the domestic manufacturing that supports them will lead to American energy dominance in the 21st century,” the group said. “But to succeed, we need stable federal policy that keeps private capital flowing while respecting Congress’s commitment to fiscal responsibility.” If certain tax policies are repealed, the cost of energy for business, industry and Texas residents will increase more than 3% by 2026, according to national trade association Advanced Energy United. Earlier this month, Cornyn addressed the issue from the Senate floor, calling for certain tax cuts to be extended. “This bill — the big, beautiful bill from the House — we’re going to make it even more beautiful here in the Senate," he said.  He said failure wasn’t an option, because Americans will face the largest tax increase in American history if the tax breaks were abruptly ended. According to the senator, Texan consumers and small businesses have repeatedly voiced their dependence on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation helped them hire more people, purchase equipment that could be expensed, and provide additional benefits to their employees. “All of these small businesses, which are the primary job-creating engine in America, would be hurt, and would suffer increased costs, and have to cut somewhere in their business,” he said.

     Christian Downie receives funding from the Australian Research Council  Australian National University provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners President Donald Trump is trying to unravel the signature climate policy of his predecessor Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act, as part of a sweeping bid to dismantle the United States’ climate ambition.  The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, is a A$530 billion suite of measures that aims to turbocharge clean energy investment and slash emissions in the US. Once hailed as a game-changer for the global clean energy transition, it set in train a fierce international competition for renewable energy investment.  But the policy is now hanging by a thread, after the US House of Representatives last month narrowly passed a bill to repeal many of its clean energy measures.  Should the bill pass the Senate, billions of dollars in renewables investment once destined for the US could be looking for a new home. Now is the time for the Albanese government to woo investors with a bolder program of climate action in Australia.  The Inflation Reduction Act passed US Congress in 2022. It legislated billions of dollars in tax credits for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and geothermal plants, among other technologies. It included around A$13 billion in rebates for Americans to electrify their homes, tax credits of almost A$11,000 to electrify their cars, and billions more to establish a “green bank” and target agricultural emissions. The money flowed. Last year, almost A$420 billion was invested in the manufacture and deployment of clean energy – double that in 2021, the year before the legislation passed.  Even in the first quarter of this year, under a Trump presidency, A$103 billion was invested in clean energy tech – an increase on the first quarter results of 2024. Electric vehicle manufacturing projects, especially batteries, were standout performers.  But then came the proposed repeal. The Trump administration wants to gut tax credits for clean energy technologies. The measures passed the House of Representatives and must now clear the US Senate, where the Republicans have a margin of three votes. Initial modelling suggests the bill, if passed, could derail clean energy manufacturing in the US – including in Republican states where new projects were planned. The potential economic damage has sparked concern even among Trump’s own troops. Some Republicans last week reportedly urged the scaling back of the cuts, despite voting for the bill in the House. After the IRA was enacted, many countries followed the US’ lead – including Australia’s Albanese government, which legislated the A$22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package. So how will Trump’s unravelling of the policy affect the rest of the world?  The economic impacts are still being modelled. Some studies suggest the US could cede A$123 billion in investment to other countries. The US axing of tax credits for battery and solar technology paves the way for nations such as China and South Korea to capitalise – given, for example, they already dominate battery manufacturing. Australia should be doing its utmost to attract investors that no longer see the US as an option. Our existing policies are a start, but they are not sufficient. In February this year, Labor increased the investment capacity of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation – Australia’s “green bank” – by A$2 billion. But more will be needed if the government is serious about crowding-in private investment in low-emission technologies exiting the US. The government would also be wise to remove incentives that increase fossil fuel use. This includes the diesel fuel rebate, which encourages the use of diesel-powered trucks on mine sites. Fortescue Metals this week announced a push for the subsidy to be wound back – potentially providing the political opening Labor needs. Trump has also promised a “nuclear renaissance”, signing four executive orders designed to reinvigorate the US nuclear energy industry.   But those measures are likely to fail, just as Trump’s 2016 promise to revive the coal industry never eventuated. In fact, his cuts to the Loan Programs Office – which helps finance new energy projects including nuclear – threaten to undermine the viability of new nuclear plants. The office has been the guarantor for every new US nuclear plant this century, bar one. If the US is struggling to scale up its existing nuclear industry, this does not bode well for the technology’s hopes in Australia. Here, the prospect of a nuclear energy policy still appears alive in the Coalition party room, even though the technology remains politically unpopular, and the economics don’t stack up. Predicting US climate and energy policy is a fool’s errand, given the potential IRA repeal, flip-flopping tariff announcements and daily social media tirades from Trump, including a social media bust-up with former ally Elon Musk over the merits of the repeal itself. Stepping back from the politics, we cannot ignore the climate harms flowing from a walk-back on US climate action.  The US is the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. As climate change reaches new extremes, the policy vacuum created by Donald Trump must urgently be filled by the rest of the world.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin holds up a signed policy proposal related to power plants at the EPA headquarters in Washington on Wednesday. | Francis Chung/POLITICO The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it’s revoking limits on power plants’ climate pollution — removing the cornerstone of a decadelong strategy to douse one of the nation’s largest sources of heat-trapping gases. The proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency would free thousands of existing and future facilities that burn coal or natural gas from regulations aimed at lowering their output of carbon dioxide pollution. It comes as President Donald Trump has shuttered climate change offices across the government, fired scientists and frozen billions of dollars in funding for renewable energy projects. EPA’s plan to unshackle the power sector — the second-largest source of U.S. climate pollution, behind transportation — collides with the agency’s past assertions that the most effective way to slow rising temperatures is by tackling the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases. Administrator Lee Zeldin has reversed that argument. His proposed repeal of President Joe Biden’s 2024 power plant climate rule asserts that the electricity-generating facilities contribute too little climate pollution globally to warrant being regulated. That’s even though the United States is the world’s second-largest climate polluter, ranking only behind China. The U.S. power sector releases more carbon emissions than all but five countries. EPA’s new rule said that greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. fossil fuel power plants are not significant because they “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions; cost-effective control measures are not reasonably available; and because this Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.” Power plants are responsible for almost a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, or about 2.7 percent of all global climate pollution, according to EPA. The agency argued in its proposed rollback that the facilities’ don’t contribute “significantly” to global warming, using language from a legal threshold for regulation in the Clean Air Act. The assertion promises to ignite court challenges from green groups and Democratic-led states.  “The collision between Republican political imperatives driven by the fossil fuel industry and fact and reality is particularly apparent in this because power plant emissions in the United States are a very significant part of global emissions,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “So it’s just plain false to pretend this isn’t a big deal.” If the courts uphold the EPA rule, which the administration expects to finalize this year, it could free the government from legal requirements to regulate climate emissions from other stationary sources such as refineries and industrial facilities. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin arrives to speak during a policy announcement at the EPA headquarters in Washington on Wednesday.  |  Francis Chung/POLITICO The administration also announced it will roll back (Reg. 2060-AW68) a separate Biden-era rule aimed at reducing power plants’ releases of toxic mercury into the air (Reg. 2060-AV53), strengthening the original Obama-era standards. EPA’s plan also targets a 2015 rule requiring new coal plants to capture a share of their carbon emissions. The Obama-era standard remained on the books throughout the first Trump administration — largely because no new coal-fired power plants were planned. The rollback comes as EPA targets the scientific underpinning for its authority to limit climate pollution — not just from power plants, but also the transportation sector, the largest U.S. source of warming gases. Called the endangerment finding, the landmark 2009 conclusion found that greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health. EPA is expected to announce later this year whether it plans to repeal that finding, a step that could allow the Trump administration to stop regulating climate pollution from cars and trucks. Together, those vehicles are responsible for about 30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions or around 3.4 percent globally. To regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to determine that such pollution “causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” In the final days of Trump’s first term in January 2021, EPA issued a surprise rule defining the significance threshold at 3 percent of U.S. emissions. Such a level would have maintained regulation over power plants but exempted every other industry, including oil and gas production, oil refining and industrial boilers used in a variety of manufacturing sectors. The rule was later vacated in court because the Trump administration had issued it as a final rule without going through the required public rulemaking process. This time, EPA is going even further by effectively saying that no industry in the U.S. contributes “significantly” to climate change, and thus the agency has no authority to regulate (Reg. 2060-AW55). Yet the U.S. has contributed one-fifth of the pollution that has driven climate change to date and remains the world’s second-largest source of planet-heating gases. That means greenhouse gases from any U.S. sector intensify warming, said Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate science professor at Stanford University. The science shows that each increment of warming from those emissions causes a “multiple, exponential effect” in terms of the impacts to the planet, he said. That brings severe economic costs. Diffenbaugh’s research group found that over a nearly 30-year period, heavier precipitation linked to climate change resulted in 36 percent of U.S. financial losses from flooding, while hotter temperatures caused about 20 percent of insured crop losses. Damages amounted to tens of billions of dollars. “We can absolutely expect the stresses that we experience from the climate system to accelerate,” he said. “How much of that we experience really does depend on how much humans emit going forward in the future.” The agency is also proposing to repeal the Biden administration’s power plant climate rule (Reg. 2060-AV09). That regulation effectively required coal-fired power plants planning to operate long-term to install technology to capture most of their carbon emissions — something no coal plant in the U.S. has ever done on that scale. It also required some new gas-fired power plants to eventually install carbon capture systems. Industry groups have argued that using carbon capture systems as the rule’s benchmark technology was impractical and possibly illegal. During oral arguments over the rule in December, several federal appellate judges questioned whether carbon capture technology was ready for the kind of wide-scale deployment EPA’s rule would require — even if the agency expected most power plants would choose to shut down rather than invest significant sums in pollution controls. The court never decided whether Biden’s rule was lawful. The 2024 rule would also have required coal plants that commit to closing by 2039 to reduce emissions by co-firing with gas — a requirement the Trump administration proposed to strike down because it says it violates a Supreme Court prohibition on fuel shifting. The Biden rule was EPA’s third effort to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants. In 2015, the Obama administration issued the Clean Power Plan, which relied heavily on utilities shifting away from coal and toward natural gas and renewables to reduce climate pollution across the electricity sector. The Supreme Court later ruled that the plan overstepped the agency’s authority, which the justices said is limited to addressing pollution from specific sources as opposed to entire industries. During Trump’s first term, EPA issued a rule requiring only minor efficiency upgrades to coal plants. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck that down because EPA had refused to consider other methods of emissions reductions. Despite EPA spinning its wheels on tackling power plant climate pollution for more than a decade, the sector has reduced its emissions anyway — by about 41 percent from its peak in 2007, according to EPA data. The decrease was caused by a long-term shift away from coal as market forces and the risk of EPA eventually imposing climate rules pushed the sector to use more natural gas and renewable energy. Zack Colman, Annie Snider and Josh Siegel contributed to this report.

[ActiveJob] [BulkSentimentAnalysisJob] [cb6b19ae-3b49-4988-9fb8-3cff0c262736] AKT--Success article_content: Altering the budget reconciliation bill could boost domestic manufacturing growth. Read More The opinions expressed here by Trellis expert contributors are their own, not those of Trellis.​ It’s crunch time for federal clean energy policy — and the consequences for the American economy are enormous. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill that would all but eliminate the federal clean energy tax credits that were extended and expanded by Congress in 2022. That legislation — and the long-term certainty it provided the private sector — powered an investment boom to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, as businesses quickly got to work building factories to produce clean technologies in the U.S. and new energy infrastructure to affordably and quickly meet the nation’s rising electricity demand. The goals of domestic manufacturing growth, affordable power and U.S. competitiveness are regularly touted by the Trump administration, yet the legislation passed by the House would undermine all three. By cutting off or overcomplicating most incentives, the bill would increase electricity rates by 10 percent or more, exacerbating inflation by making power more scarce at a time when we need more of it to support AI and other new technologies. It would kneecap U.S. growth and innovation in growing global industries such as electric vehicles, batteries and clean power infrastructure. And it would scrap major industrial projects at risk of hundreds of thousands of jobs. As Michael Tubman, the federal policy director at the electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid, said at a recent media briefing: “Anyone who has visited our [Arizona] factory can see the evidence plainly in front of them of the jobs — the high quality, high paying jobs that these incentives are supporting.” With the Senate working on its version of the legislation, companies still have time to make an impact. More than 30 companies are headed to Capitol Hill this week for a series of meetings with Senate Republicans, where they will emphasize the tax credits’ vast economic benefits.  But companies don’t need to be in D.C. to take action. For sustainability professionals, the tax credits are crucial to meeting company goals, so now is the time for them to work with government affairs and executive teams to get in touch with the senators in states where they operate to make the case that gutting these incentives would be a self-inflicted wound to U.S. economic, energy and geopolitical interests. To prevent that outcome, businesses should press the Senate to fix four major flaws in the House bill: The House bill changes the current rules so that projects must be fully completed and operational — rather than merely under construction — to qualify for the credits. But between permitting issues, supply chain disruptions, litigation and other unpredictable factors, the timing of a project is often well beyond a company’s control. The proposed change would therefore create uncertainty about whether even projects that are ready to break ground will qualify for tax credits, especially because the House legislation imposes a shorter timeline before the credits expire. The likely result: stalled investment, meaning less new energy and higher electricity prices. The Senate should stick with the existing “commence construction” requirement and set a more realistic expiration timeline than the House.  The House bill includes overly burdensome restrictions on the use of foreign components for projects claiming tax credits. A major goal of these tax credits is to support U.S. manufacturing and supply chains to reduce reliance on foreign adversaries for critical materials and infrastructure. But the proposed changes are so severe that they’re essentially unworkable. A $50 part, unknowingly sourced through a third-party supplier, could upend a billion-dollar project. That is a huge amount of risk for any company to take on. To comply, companies would need to immediately hire teams to closely inspect every link on their supply chains instead of hiring American workers to build and install cost-saving technologies. More likely, investment would just freeze up amid all the regulatory uncertainty as they await the final regulations for fear of noncompliance.  The Senate can take a more clear, practical and simplified approach that applies to the taxpayer entity, company, or project, so that businesses can confidently and quickly invest in high-value domestic manufacturing, supply chains and energy production without ambiguity and red tape.  Clean energy tax credits are currently fully transferable — meaning developers that don’t have tax liability can sell them to businesses that do. It’s a win-win for buyers and sellers, creating an efficient and competitive market that ensures the incentives are put to work in the economy. The House bill would end that system, limiting transfers to a handful of large financial institutions that directly invest in the projects. This would weaken the financial viability of the projects, but it would also deprive companies across the economy of an opportunity to participate in project financing through tax credit transfers. The Senate should preserve transferability to keep the market functioning at its best. The House’s plan would also hurt consumers’ ability to afford modern and efficient technologies such as electric vehicles, rooftop solar panels and heat pumps by ending tax credits as soon as this year. While that would most immediately harm consumers and the companies selling those products, the consequences wouldn’t end there. Reduced consumer demand would ripple across the economy, slowing investment in key 21st-century capabilities such as advanced manufacturing, battery production and critical mineral supplies, as well as more foundational sectors such as steel, glass and aluminum. The Senate can recognize that consumer demand is another form of policy certainty that drives investment across the economy and that keeping these credits in place will help maintain our global economic leadership. The outcome in Congress will have major consequences for businesses across the economy — not just those making or buying clean technologies but all who depend on affordable power, strong domestic supply chains and U.S. global leadership. With those strengths at risk, their voices have never been more important on Capitol Hill.

[ActiveJob] [BulkSentimentAnalysisJob] [cb6b19ae-3b49-4988-9fb8-3cff0c262736] AKT--Success article_content: To keep solar farms from getting overrun with weeds, energy companies like Pivot Energy have been trading in traditional lawnmowers for an unconventional means: sheep. The field of agrivoltaics has been steadily growing and is mutually beneficial to farmers and solar companies alike. The logic to using the sheep is simple: where lawnmowers and weed whackers are unwieldy and difficult to maneuver amidst the metal stands, dangling wires and large solar canopies, sheep are able to nimbly move around and gobble down the green. It’s a practice that Pivot Energy has brought to the fields of the metro-east. Utilizing the sheep comes with the benefit of establishing partnerships with agricultural entities, keeping local farmers and shepherds employed in non-traditional way, an official with Pivot says. While solar companies get a low-cost means of keeping their locations tidy, farmers get new grazing land for their livestock. “As farmers, we’re always looking to build our herd,” says Curtis Thompson, owner of Freedom Farms in Kinmundy in Marion County. “To do that, we always need new pastures. This helps provide that — it’s a win-win.” Thompson, who is a realtor as his primary career, says he has been solar grazing since 2020 and says the contracts help provide extra funds for the farm he runs in his free time. He is a member of the American Solar Grazing Association, a coalition of farmers with a goal of “upholding our nation’s agricultural heritage while embracing new opportunities.”  Thompson’s sheep graze at a handful of sites in the metro-east. They’re currently grazing in Salem, but solar farms in East St. Louis also benefit the flock. These ravenous ruminants provide an easy, simple way to landscape requiring little oversight, he says. Smaller sites typically require a week’s time for the sheep to graze, while larger locations will keep sheep on site throughout the growing season, which runs from March to June. When Thompson has a grazing contract, he says he simply drops the sheep off, leaves them there for a week or so and picks them up when the foliage has been acceptably grazed. Using other animals, like cows and goats, bring concerns about safety of both themselves as well as the solar equipment, Thompson says. The same can’t be same for sheep.  “They tried goats and goats will chew through wires, they tried cattle and they’ll tear the panels, but there’s never been any safety concerns with sheep,” he said. “All we have to do is drop them off and check on them periodically.” Pivot Energy has more than 80 solar sites, and 98% of them use sheep as a means of landscaping, said Angie Burke, director of operations and maintenance for Pivot Engergy. “The sheep are kind of specially built to do this for us,” Burke said. “Instead of paying someone to come mow and landscape four five times a year, we’d rather pay a farmer to come out here and do the lamb-scaping for us.” Burke, who lives in Denver and provides training for those interested in participating in agrivoltaics, says there are actually fewer risks involved in using sheep than more conventional methods, like lawnmowers. “We personally feel that having sheep on site actually decreases the risks of damage compared to mechanical landscaping,” she said. “The sheep aren’t likely to knock a stone up that will break the glass of a solar panel or clip one of the wires, and we either don’t have to adjust or only have to minimally adjust the site to accommodate the sheep. It’s also cost competitive, with the added benefits of improving the land and the farmer.” Pivot Energy doesn’t own most of the land it uses to build their solar farms, but leases it from farmers. By allowing sheep to peruse the greenery, the companies go an extra step toward paying farmers and keeping their herds growing. Pivot energy is considering implementing the use of chickens or pigs, Burke said. Some sites already utilize llamas and alpacas. Most of the farmers are contracted months in advance and often go to multiple sites, with preference given to repeat contracts in it for the long run. “I have a lot of sheep contacts in my phone now,” Burke said.

																			 The Tata Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition (TCI) and Preservation and Proliferation of Rural Resources and Nature (PRAN) have set up an agrivoltaics site in Bihar’s Gaya district. Agrivoltaics combines agriculture and solar power generation in an effort to prevent food production and energy production from competing for land. On a typical agrivoltaics site, shade-tolerant crops grow beneath solar panels, allowing farmers to produce food while generating electricity. The site was built through a partnership between TCI and PRAN, with assistance from Jain Irrigation Systems, TCI said in a statement. The first agrivoltaics site to operate in Bihar, the TCI-PRAN site, located in the village of Nawada in Shargati block, demonstrates the potential for agrivoltaics to help lower greenhouse gas emissions from farming while increasing productivity.

					 Energy generated by a 20-kilowatt solar array at TCI-PRAN site is used to power a grain mill and micro-irrigation systems. With support from TCI, the participating farmers co-financed and collectively own the installation. Access to reliable and affordable irrigation will allow the farmers to begin growing crops during dry seasons.  The farms utilize drip and sprinkler systems, reducing the amount of water needed for cultivation. The farmers will also generate income by charging for grain mill services. “This site is a significant step forward for agrivoltaics and sustainable agriculture in Bihar, demonstrating that climate-smart technologies can be a boon for both emissions reduction and crop production”, TCI Director Prabhu Pingali said. “We hope that farmers and policymakers learn from this installation to increase the effective adoption of agrivoltaics in Bihar and throughout India.” In the future, TCI will aim to provide additional evidence on options for scaling up agrivoltaics systems. At the Nawada installation, TCI researchers will monitor its activities to explore how agrivoltaics might work in Bihar. They will pay particular attention to whether the site fulfills the farmers’ irrigation and grain processing needs and how it affects crop production and farmer incomes. “We hope and expect that the availability of solar-powered irrigation will enable the farmers to expand their production to include high-value crops that they otherwise would not grow, which should result in increased income,” said Milorad Plavsic, TCI’s manager for strategic initiatives, who oversees the project for TCI. “This is a unique project as it unites agricultural and solar power production, which enables a group of farmers to experiment with different intercropping designs and maximize income from their land while conserving water and reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” PRAN Director Anil Verma said. “In the following months, the PRAN team will support farmers and their family members through various capacity-building activities to ensure the sustainability of this agrivoltaics site.” The site in Nawada is part of TCI’s Zero-Hunger, Zero-Carbon Food Systems project, which aims to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture while improving productivity and benefitting farmer livelihoods in Bihar.  Now in its second phase, researchers are assessing the real-world impact of several emissions-reducing interventions. In addition to agrivoltaics TCI is studying advanced crop management for rice production systems and the use of advanced breeding technology and methane-reducing feed supplements for livestock production.

     Christian Downie receives funding from the Australian Research Council  Australian National University provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners Share article Copy article link Print article President Donald Trump is trying to unravel the signature climate policy of his predecessor Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act, as part of a sweeping bid to dismantle the United States’ climate ambition.  The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, is a A$530 billion suite of measures that aims to turbocharge clean energy investment and slash emissions in the US. Once hailed as a game-changer for the global clean energy transition, it set in train a fierce international competition for renewable energy investment.  But the policy is now hanging by a thread, after the US House of Representatives last month narrowly passed a bill to repeal many of its clean energy measures.  Should the bill pass the Senate, billions of dollars in renewables investment once destined for the US could be looking for a new home. Now is the time for the Albanese government to woo investors with a bolder program of climate action in Australia.  The Inflation Reduction Act passed US Congress in 2022. It legislated billions of dollars in tax credits for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and geothermal plants, among other technologies. It included around A$13 billion in rebates for Americans to electrify their homes, tax credits of almost A$11,000 to electrify their cars, and billions more to establish a “green bank” and target agricultural emissions. The money flowed. Last year, almost A$420 billion was invested in the manufacture and deployment of clean energy – double that in 2021, the year before the legislation passed.  Even in the first quarter of this year, under a Trump presidency, A$103 billion was invested in clean energy tech – an increase on the first quarter results of 2024. Electric vehicle manufacturing projects, especially batteries, were standout performers.  But then came the proposed repeal. The Trump administration wants to gut tax credits for clean energy technologies. The measures passed the House of Representatives and must now clear the US Senate, where the Republicans have a margin of three votes. Initial modelling suggests the bill, if passed, could derail clean energy manufacturing in the US – including in Republican states where new projects were planned. The potential economic damage has sparked concern even among Trump’s own troops. Some Republicans last week reportedly urged the scaling back of the cuts, despite voting for the bill in the House. After the IRA was enacted, many countries followed the US’ lead – including Australia’s Albanese government, which legislated the A$22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package. So how will Trump’s unravelling of the policy affect the rest of the world?  The economic impacts are still being modelled. Some studies suggest the US could cede A$123 billion in investment to other countries. The US axing of tax credits for battery and solar technology paves the way for nations such as China and South Korea to capitalise – given, for example, they already dominate battery manufacturing. Australia should be doing its utmost to attract investors that no longer see the US as an option. Our existing policies are a start, but they are not sufficient. In February this year, Labor increased the investment capacity of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation – Australia’s “green bank” – by A$2 billion. But more will be needed if the government is serious about crowding-in private investment in low-emission technologies exiting the US. The government would also be wise to remove incentives that increase fossil fuel use. This includes the diesel fuel rebate, which encourages the use of diesel-powered trucks on mine sites. Fortescue Metals this week announced a push for the subsidy to be wound back – potentially providing the political opening Labor needs. Trump has also promised a “nuclear renaissance”, signing four executive orders designed to reinvigorate the US nuclear energy industry.   But those measures are likely to fail, just as Trump’s 2016 promise to revive the coal industry never eventuated. In fact, his cuts to the Loan Programs Office – which helps finance new energy projects including nuclear – threaten to undermine the viability of new nuclear plants. The office has been the guarantor for every new US nuclear plant this century, bar one. If the US is struggling to scale up its existing nuclear industry, this does not bode well for the technology’s hopes in Australia. Here, the prospect of a nuclear energy policy still appears alive in the Coalition party room, even though the technology remains politically unpopular, and the economics don’t stack up. Predicting US climate and energy policy is a fool’s errand, given the potential IRA repeal, flip-flopping tariff announcements and daily social media tirades from Trump, including a social media bust-up with former ally Elon Musk over the merits of the repeal itself. Stepping back from the politics, we cannot ignore the climate harms flowing from a walk-back on US climate action.  The US is the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. As climate change reaches new extremes, the policy vacuum created by Donald Trump must urgently be filled by the rest of the world.

Read More The opinions expressed here by Trellis expert contributors are their own, not those of Trellis.​ It’s crunch time for federal clean energy policy — and the consequences for the American economy are enormous. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill that would all but eliminate the federal clean energy tax credits that were extended and expanded by Congress in 2022. That legislation — and the long-term certainty it provided the private sector — powered an investment boom to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, as businesses quickly got to work building factories to produce clean technologies in the U.S. and new energy infrastructure to affordably and quickly meet the nation’s rising electricity demand. The goals of domestic manufacturing growth, affordable power and U.S. competitiveness are regularly touted by the Trump administration, yet the legislation passed by the House would undermine all three. By cutting off or overcomplicating most incentives, the bill would increase electricity rates by 10 percent or more, exacerbating inflation by making power more scarce at a time when we need more of it to support AI and other new technologies. It would kneecap U.S. growth and innovation in growing global industries such as electric vehicles, batteries and clean power infrastructure. And it would scrap major industrial projects at risk of hundreds of thousands of jobs. As Michael Tubman, the federal policy director at the electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid, said at a recent media briefing: “Anyone who has visited our [Arizona] factory can see the evidence plainly in front of them of the jobs — the high quality, high paying jobs that these incentives are supporting.” With the Senate working on its version of the legislation, companies still have time to make an impact. More than 30 companies are headed to Capitol Hill this week for a series of meetings with Senate Republicans, where they will emphasize the tax credits’ vast economic benefits.  But companies don’t need to be in D.C. to take action. For sustainability professionals, the tax credits are crucial to meeting company goals, so now is the time for them to work with government affairs and executive teams to get in touch with the senators in states where they operate to make the case that gutting these incentives would be a self-inflicted wound to U.S. economic, energy and geopolitical interests. To prevent that outcome, businesses should press the Senate to fix four major flaws in the House bill: The House bill changes the current rules so that projects must be fully completed and operational — rather than merely under construction — to qualify for the credits. But between permitting issues, supply chain disruptions, litigation and other unpredictable factors, the timing of a project is often well beyond a company’s control. The proposed change would therefore create uncertainty about whether even projects that are ready to break ground will qualify for tax credits, especially because the House legislation imposes a shorter timeline before the credits expire. The likely result: stalled investment, meaning less new energy and higher electricity prices. The Senate should stick with the existing “commence construction” requirement and set a more realistic expiration timeline than the House.  The House bill includes overly burdensome restrictions on the use of foreign components for projects claiming tax credits. A major goal of these tax credits is to support U.S. manufacturing and supply chains to reduce reliance on foreign adversaries for critical materials and infrastructure. But the proposed changes are so severe that they’re essentially unworkable. A $50 part, unknowingly sourced through a third-party supplier, could upend a billion-dollar project. That is a huge amount of risk for any company to take on. To comply, companies would need to immediately hire teams to closely inspect every link on their supply chains instead of hiring American workers to build and install cost-saving technologies. More likely, investment would just freeze up amid all the regulatory uncertainty as they await the final regulations for fear of noncompliance.  The Senate can take a more clear, practical and simplified approach that applies to the taxpayer entity, company, or project, so that businesses can confidently and quickly invest in high-value domestic manufacturing, supply chains and energy production without ambiguity and red tape.  Clean energy tax credits are currently fully transferable — meaning developers that don’t have tax liability can sell them to businesses that do. It’s a win-win for buyers and sellers, creating an efficient and competitive market that ensures the incentives are put to work in the economy. The House bill would end that system, limiting transfers to a handful of large financial institutions that directly invest in the projects. This would weaken the financial viability of the projects, but it would also deprive companies across the economy of an opportunity to participate in project financing through tax credit transfers. The Senate should preserve transferability to keep the market functioning at its best. The House’s plan would also hurt consumers’ ability to afford modern and efficient technologies such as electric vehicles, rooftop solar panels and heat pumps by ending tax credits as soon as this year. While that would most immediately harm consumers and the companies selling those products, the consequences wouldn’t end there. Reduced consumer demand would ripple across the economy, slowing investment in key 21st-century capabilities such as advanced manufacturing, battery production and critical mineral supplies, as well as more foundational sectors such as steel, glass and aluminum. The Senate can recognize that consumer demand is another form of policy certainty that drives investment across the economy and that keeping these credits in place will help maintain our global economic leadership. The outcome in Congress will have major consequences for businesses across the economy — not just those making or buying clean technologies but all who depend on affordable power, strong domestic supply chains and U.S. global leadership. With those strengths at risk, their voices have never been more important on Capitol Hill.

Combined, the projects are anticipated to contribute $73 million in direct economic impact over the first 20 years of operations.   "The addition of Ross and Fayette to our Ohio operating portfolio brings our collective projected economic impact to more than $160 million across the Buckeye state," said Blake Nixon, President and CEO of Geronimo Power. "We're proud of the footprint we've built here, and we want to extend a huge thank you to the state of Ohio and our project host communities for opening their doors to our business and investments." Joining the previously announced Yellowbud Solar project, the 120-megawatt (MW) Ross and 47.5 MW Fayette will contribute $29.5 million in new tax revenue, which will be distributed to local counties, emergency services, school districts and additional funding for the Ohio PILOT Program. Additionally, the company recently announced the start of construction at its Dodson Creek and Sycamore Creek Solar projects. Combined, all five projects will culminate in more than 675 MW of clean energy produced in the state once all five projects are operational. "I have lived in the area for more than 45 years and have found the nearby solar facilities to provide a welcome change to my community," said Duane Ross, a Fayette project landowner. "The Ross and Fayette solar projects will provide essential revenue streams for residents in this area, and I hope to see more solar projects producing clean energy in the future." To commemorate the projects and the benefits they provide, Geronimo hosted a "Solar Harvest Festival" last October with landowners, community members and project partners. The fall-themed event was sourced primarily from local businesses and featured a short tour of the Ross project, during which attendees had the opportunity to view and learn more about the inner workings of a solar farm. Prior to the event, Geronimo announced its pledge to donate $670,000 in charitable funding through the Ross and Fayette projects over the first 20 years of operations. Representatives from The Chillicothe-Ross Community Foundation and The Greenfield Foundation, who will manage the charitable funds, were present at the event and provided commemorative checks to signify the upcoming charitable donations. In addition to the economic benefits provided by Ross and Fayette, the projects provide many environmental benefits to local communities. Using the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator, the projects combined are anticipated to offset carbon dioxide emissions by 4.5 million metric tons over the first 20 years.

[ActiveJob] [BulkSentimentAnalysisJob] [c24e3d84-4575-4be0-977b-e3d29f0cf095] AKT--Success article_content: To keep solar farms from getting overrun with weeds, energy companies like Pivot Energy have been trading in traditional lawnmowers for an unconventional means: sheep. The field of agrivoltaics has been steadily growing and is mutually beneficial to farmers and solar companies alike. The logic to using the sheep is simple: where lawnmowers and weed whackers are unwieldy and difficult to maneuver amidst the metal stands, dangling wires and large solar canopies, sheep are able to nimbly move around and gobble down the green. It’s a practice that Pivot Energy has brought to the fields of the metro-east. Utilizing the sheep comes with the benefit of establishing partnerships with agricultural entities, keeping local farmers and shepherds employed in non-traditional way, an official with Pivot says. While solar companies get a low-cost means of keeping their locations tidy, farmers get new grazing land for their livestock. “As farmers, we’re always looking to build our herd,” says Curtis Thompson, owner of Freedom Farms in Kinmundy in Marion County. “To do that, we always need new pastures. This helps provide that — it’s a win-win.” Thompson, who is a realtor as his primary career, says he has been solar grazing since 2020 and says the contracts help provide extra funds for the farm he runs in his free time. He is a member of the American Solar Grazing Association, a coalition of farmers with a goal of “upholding our nation’s agricultural heritage while embracing new opportunities.”  Thompson’s sheep graze at a handful of sites in the metro-east. They’re currently grazing in Salem, but solar farms in East St. Louis also benefit the flock. These ravenous ruminants provide an easy, simple way to landscape requiring little oversight, he says. Smaller sites typically require a week’s time for the sheep to graze, while larger locations will keep sheep on site throughout the growing season, which runs from March to June. When Thompson has a grazing contract, he says he simply drops the sheep off, leaves them there for a week or so and picks them up when the foliage has been acceptably grazed. Using other animals, like cows and goats, bring concerns about safety of both themselves as well as the solar equipment, Thompson says. The same can’t be same for sheep.  “They tried goats and goats will chew through wires, they tried cattle and they’ll tear the panels, but there’s never been any safety concerns with sheep,” he said. “All we have to do is drop them off and check on them periodically.” Pivot Energy has more than 80 solar sites, and 98% of them use sheep as a means of landscaping, said Angie Burke, director of operations and maintenance for Pivot Engergy. “The sheep are kind of specially built to do this for us,” Burke said. “Instead of paying someone to come mow and landscape four five times a year, we’d rather pay a farmer to come out here and do the lamb-scaping for us.” Burke, who lives in Denver and provides training for those interested in participating in agrivoltaics, says there are actually fewer risks involved in using sheep than more conventional methods, like lawnmowers. “We personally feel that having sheep on site actually decreases the risks of damage compared to mechanical landscaping,” she said. “The sheep aren’t likely to knock a stone up that will break the glass of a solar panel or clip one of the wires, and we either don’t have to adjust or only have to minimally adjust the site to accommodate the sheep. It’s also cost competitive, with the added benefits of improving the land and the farmer.” Pivot Energy doesn’t own most of the land it uses to build their solar farms, but leases it from farmers. By allowing sheep to peruse the greenery, the companies go an extra step toward paying farmers and keeping their herds growing. Pivot energy is considering implementing the use of chickens or pigs, Burke said. Some sites already utilize llamas and alpacas. Most of the farmers are contracted months in advance and often go to multiple sites, with preference given to repeat contracts in it for the long run. “I have a lot of sheep contacts in my phone now,” Burke said.

																			 The Tata Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition (TCI) and Preservation and Proliferation of Rural Resources and Nature (PRAN) have set up an agrivoltaics site in Bihar’s Gaya district. Agrivoltaics combines agriculture and solar power generation in an effort to prevent food production and energy production from competing for land. On a typical agrivoltaics site, shade-tolerant crops grow beneath solar panels, allowing farmers to produce food while generating electricity. The site was built through a partnership between TCI and PRAN, with assistance from Jain Irrigation Systems, TCI said in a statement. The first agrivoltaics site to operate in Bihar, the TCI-PRAN site, located in the village of Nawada in Shargati block, demonstrates the potential for agrivoltaics to help lower greenhouse gas emissions from farming while increasing productivity.

					 Energy generated by a 20-kilowatt solar array at TCI-PRAN site is used to power a grain mill and micro-irrigation systems. With support from TCI, the participating farmers co-financed and collectively own the installation. Access to reliable and affordable irrigation will allow the farmers to begin growing crops during dry seasons.  The farms utilize drip and sprinkler systems, reducing the amount of water needed for cultivation. The farmers will also generate income by charging for grain mill services. “This site is a significant step forward for agrivoltaics and sustainable agriculture in Bihar, demonstrating that climate-smart technologies can be a boon for both emissions reduction and crop production”, TCI Director Prabhu Pingali said. “We hope that farmers and policymakers learn from this installation to increase the effective adoption of agrivoltaics in Bihar and throughout India.” In the future, TCI will aim to provide additional evidence on options for scaling up agrivoltaics systems. At the Nawada installation, TCI researchers will monitor its activities to explore how agrivoltaics might work in Bihar. They will pay particular attention to whether the site fulfills the farmers’ irrigation and grain processing needs and how it affects crop production and farmer incomes. “We hope and expect that the availability of solar-powered irrigation will enable the farmers to expand their production to include high-value crops that they otherwise would not grow, which should result in increased income,” said Milorad Plavsic, TCI’s manager for strategic initiatives, who oversees the project for TCI. “This is a unique project as it unites agricultural and solar power production, which enables a group of farmers to experiment with different intercropping designs and maximize income from their land while conserving water and reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” PRAN Director Anil Verma said. “In the following months, the PRAN team will support farmers and their family members through various capacity-building activities to ensure the sustainability of this agrivoltaics site.” The site in Nawada is part of TCI’s Zero-Hunger, Zero-Carbon Food Systems project, which aims to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture while improving productivity and benefitting farmer livelihoods in Bihar.  Now in its second phase, researchers are assessing the real-world impact of several emissions-reducing interventions. In addition to agrivoltaics TCI is studying advanced crop management for rice production systems and the use of advanced breeding technology and methane-reducing feed supplements for livestock production.

[ActiveJob] [BulkSentimentAnalysisJob] [c24e3d84-4575-4be0-977b-e3d29f0cf095] AKT--Success p_content: News  Energy and Natural Resources Reporter More than a dozen Texas-based energy companies have penned a letter pushing back on President Trump’s signature "Big Beautiful Bill,“ arguing the legislation could stunt economic development, hike consumer energy costs and kill jobs in the state.  The sweeping tax and spending bill was passed by the U.S. House on May 22 and is pending in the Senate. The bill’s provisions include accelerating the repeal of renewable energy tax credits, such as the Clean Electricity Investment Credit and Residential Clean Energy Credit. The Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance ― comprised of companies that operate in the clean energy space, including Schneider Electric, XGS Energy, EnPhase and EDF ― wrote to GOP Senator John Cornyn in an effort to preserve key tax credits. They argue those initiatives have aided in the success of the state’s energy industry. “Texas is projected to see over $458 billion new private sector investment and $54 billion in new advanced energy manufacturing — private investment catalyzed by sensible, technology-agnostic federal tax credits," the letter reads.

According to the alliance, projects being developed across the state would be impacted, including a battery and microinverter manufacturer facility in Arlington, an electric vehicle charging manufacturer also in Arlington and a rare Earth manufacturer near Fort Worth. The group — representing a cross-section of companies headquartered, building projects and facilities, creating jobs and investing billions of dollars in the state — said they intend to keep Texas an energy leader as the state and nation is poised to experience a surge in electricity demand for the first time in more than two decades. With the growth of artificial intelligence, building electrification and advanced manufacturing addressing the energy need will require a diverse, reliable energy portfolio including wind, solar and storage, nuclear, geothermal and more. The industry leaders said they have the “opportunity to accelerate the advanced manufacturing renaissance” that creates jobs, bolsters the economy and allows America to compete with the rest of the world. “Advanced energy technologies and the domestic manufacturing that supports them will lead to American energy dominance in the 21st century,” the group said. “But to succeed, we need stable federal policy that keeps private capital flowing while respecting Congress’s commitment to fiscal responsibility.” If certain tax policies are repealed, the cost of energy for business, industry and Texas residents will increase more than 3% by 2026, according to national trade association Advanced Energy United. Earlier this month, Cornyn addressed the issue from the Senate floor, calling for certain tax cuts to be extended. “This bill — the big, beautiful bill from the House — we’re going to make it even more beautiful here in the Senate," he said.  He said failure wasn’t an option, because Americans will face the largest tax increase in American history if the tax breaks were abruptly ended. According to the senator, Texan consumers and small businesses have repeatedly voiced their dependence on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation helped them hire more people, purchase equipment that could be expensed, and provide additional benefits to their employees. “All of these small businesses, which are the primary job-creating engine in America, would be hurt, and would suffer increased costs, and have to cut somewhere in their business,” he said.
